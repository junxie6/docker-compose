# Virtual Hosts
#
# Required modules: mod_log_config

# If you want to maintain multiple domains/hostnames on your
# machine you can setup VirtualHost containers for them. Most configurations
# use only name-based virtual hosts so the server doesn't need to worry about
# IP addresses. This is indicated by the asterisks in the directives below.
#
# Please see the documentation at 
# <URL:http://httpd.apache.org/docs/2.4/vhosts/>
# for further details before you try to setup virtual hosts.
#
# You may use the command line option '-S' to verify your virtual host
# configuration.

#
# VirtualHost example:
# Almost any Apache directive may go into a VirtualHost container.
# The first VirtualHost section is used for all requests that do not
# match a ServerName or ServerAlias in any <VirtualHost> block.

    ### a request for / will need to be mapped to a resource on the fcgi backend.
    ### Failure to address this may cause a blank response, commonly known as a WSOD (White Screen of Death),
    ### especially if only a request URI containing the php extension is proxied, such as this example.
    ### The processing chain will first map a request for / to /index.php, then proxy to the PHP-FPM backend correctly.
